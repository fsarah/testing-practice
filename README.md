# A repository for my tries at testing

### Installation

Install the latest version of the [selenium standalone server](www.seleniumhq.org/download), then put it in the project folder.

Download the used driver - in this case, geckodriver or/and chrome headless were used for implementation, so one of those would work well. Unpack the driver and put it into the project folder, as well.
